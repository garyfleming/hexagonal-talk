# Blueprints and Hexagons

This talk was first given at Techmeetup Glasgow, on January 27th 2016.

The slides are available in the original Markdown format (hexagonal-ds.md), which can be opened using [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com). As the theme isn't preserved, I used the "Next" theme with the blue-on-gray colouring (currently the second choice in that theme).

I've expanded the speaker notes from the original short note form to (still short) sentences explaining the ideas more fully.

If you don't have access to Deckset but still want the visuals alongside the notes, I've exported the slides as a PDF.

I'm also including the further reading and acknowledgements below, for your convenience.

## TODO

- Introduce the idea of the software engineering metaphor
- More explicit examples as we go (ports, adapters etc). Maybe introduce the main example at the start.
- Add in parts to explain cross cutting domain entities vs bounded context entities
- Possibly talk a little about DDD and bounded contexts
- Relate to Dependency Inversion Principle
- Explain how it doesn't necessarily mean more code
- Bonus: caching -- obvious where it fits: the edges.
- Be explicit about what actions can take after hearing the principles

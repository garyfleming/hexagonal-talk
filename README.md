# Blueprints and Hexagons

This talk was first given at Techmeetup Glasgow, on January 27th 2016.

The slides are available in the original Markdown format (hexagonal-ds.md), which can be opened using [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com). As the theme isn't preserved, I used the "Next" theme with the blue-on-gray colouring (currently the second choice in that theme).

I've expanded the speaker notes from the original short note form to (still short) sentences explaining the ideas more fully.

If you don't have access to Deckset but still want the visuals alongside the notes, I've exported the slides as a PDF.
